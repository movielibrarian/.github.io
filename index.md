## Introduction 

I added a History minor because I figured I should get another piece of paper for the credits I was taking outside of the Media School. Upon seeing the course name “Digital History”, I thought that would marry my interest in technology, specifically film and television, and this newfound interest. I was off, to say the least. Digital History is the application of modern methods (networks, timelines, and text analysis) that help historians discover, organize, and present their findings. Before this course, it never occurred to me that history required evolution. But as the semester progressed, I realized that history depends on the evolution of new technologies and methods in order to make new discoveries. Without Digital History, the mother field itself will disintegrate into something that people will look back and ponder. 

In this Digital History project, I used three different ways to discover, organize, and present my findings on how the male gaze has transitioned from academia to 2000’s science fiction films. I used an Ngram viewer to show how the term has increased in frequency over time. I used a timeline to help organize how and when primary sources came before the films were observed. I finally used a text analysis tool, Voyant, to see how often the term male gaze comes up and what other terms it is most correlated to. All this in conjunction will reveal how the term has transitioned from academia to film. 

The idea originally came from my interest in the Bechdel test, all of these terms stemming from my study and passion for film and television, given that my major is Media and Cinema Arts with a concentration in screenwriting. Regardless, I found that the Bechdel test is not something that was easily measured in film and TV, given my wide selection of genres and the overwhelming catalog of films. After all, I was limited to eight weeks to find a topic, analyze my findings, and present them. I remembered a class I took last semester, titled “Screening Race and Ethnicity”. We examined different films and topics regarding race and ethnicity and how they applied to today. I remember talking about orientalism and how it totally changed my view on Iron Man. We talked about military involvement in film production and how Transformers was basically U.S. propaganda. I talk about both of these films in my timeline, but in regards to the male gaze. The male gaze particularly fascinated me because it’s how films are made traditionally. 

So, with all this in mind, how has the male gaze transitioned from academia to 2000’s science fiction films, specifically the Marvel, DC, and Transformers franchises? 


## Breaking Down the Male Gaze 

To begin this long and tedious process, I had to break down my question into smaller questions. That way, when I answered smaller questions, as a whole, I would potentially have an answer to my big question. 

What is the male gaze? Who uses these terms?   What are the Marvel, DC, and Transformers franchises? What does a transition entail? What does it mean to be in an academic world vs. popular culture? How can we do better? Is there such a thing as the female gaze? 


## Ngram Viewer: A Term Over Time

## A Look Through Time: What does this mean? 

As we follow the line throughout time, the term “the male gaze” doesn’t appear to jump of the charts until the 1980’s. This makes sense, as Laura Mulvey’s piece wasn’t published until 1975, which is roughly that time period. The term’s frequency of use continued to rise until about 2006, when the use dropped slightly until 2010. From that year on, the term’s use has begun to skyrocket, similar to its jump in the 80’s and 90’s. As I began to look at the dates on my primary text sources, I realized that of the four, two were written in the 90’s, one being Laura Mulvey’s written in 1975, and one in 2007. This means that my primary text sources most likely contributed to this rise and I needed to find out their relation to the films. By placing them in a timeline, I could examine the subsequent order of the texts, primary and secondary, and films, organizing them in an efficient and organized visual manner. 


## A Timeline of the Male Gaze in 2000's Science Fiction

### Timeline Process: Challenges, Pros/Cons, Findings

After discovering that an Ngram viewer would not be enough to fully understand how the male gaze has transitioned from academia to the three science fiction franchises of the 2000’s, I decided to visualize them via a timeline. A timeline, as mentioned above, would allow me to understand how the primary text sources, secondary text sources, and primary film sources would interact with each other in relation to the Ngram viewer. This way, I could understand the context of the male gaze in relation to all of my sources. Not just that, but I could do it in a visually interesting way that was organizational and accessible to my findings. As the semester went on, I realized that digital history can be more than one presentation, as long as your findings are easily interpreted and accessible to your readers. If a timeline would help me, so be it. 

First, I began by inputting all of my primary text sources into the timeline, as well as images of their authors, all of whom are women. This was interesting because women were writing about being sexualized by men, rather than me writing about women being sexualized by other men. I thought that added another layer to the project, as women were critical of men instead of men being critical of members of their own gender. I also think this adds something to the text analysis, which I will detail later. 

Next, I added all of my secondary text sources. This allowed me to see their relation to the primary sources,  however, it did not allow me to see how the secondary sources built off of the primary sources. I attempted to add in pictures of secondary sources, which were mostly women, but interestingly some men. I finally added in my primary film sources, which was difficult. Some of these films I have never seen, but their use of the male gaze is quite obvious, given the film promotional posters, and some stills I pulled from the films, sexualizing or demeaning the female main characters. My main challenge was inserting these images into the timeline, as errors displaying them would repeatedly pop up due to website permissions. The sheer amount of sources was also a significant factor, being a major consumer of time. 
The pros of the timeline have been previously mentioned: the ability to easily see and access the organization of the information in a chronological order. Another pro included being able to organize all my sources based on primary text source, secondary text source, and primary film example. However, a major con of the timeline constricted me to word count and not being able to see similarities in content in all of my sources. Another con includes not being able to see the information all at once, or rather, as the “big picture”. This explicit finding of the timeline led me to the conclusion that I needed to do a text analysis. 


## Text Analysis

### Text Analysis Results: What are scholars saying?

In beginning this project, I surveyed a number of sources that contained relevant information to my project. I needed to find a number of sources that both supported my intended answer to my question (the observance of a visual change overtime) and that also fought it. In learning about digital history, and research as a whole, it’s important to examine sources that are both relevant and not relevant to your research question. That way, you get an encapsulating, inclusive answer to your question. One of my sources looked at dance and bollywood. Another looks at Hitchcock, a household name in the industry not known for his work in science fiction. However, all of these make arguments that female bodies are exploited in film. 

First, I had to take all of the texts and compile them into one document. Then, I had to convert that into a text file, and upload it to Voyant tools. I then ran the corpus and examined the results. When looking at the analysis, it’s important to organize the information in a way that best represents your findings. As previously mentioned, it’s important that your findings are presented visually in a way that is easily comprehensible, digestible, and accessible. Otherwise, your findings would be for nothing. I decided that a word cloud would be best, as the larger the word is, the more often it appears in the text. With this in mind, comic, female, male, gaze, women, film, characters, and pleasure, are all words that jump out at me. This means that the text makes arguments that need these words to support them. This largely supports my theory that there has been a transition from academia, especially as time has gone on, to film. I also needed the center display, which scores the frequency of phrases and organizes them by topics. This way, I am able to see which words are largely correlated with each other and which ones are frequently next to each other. The honorable mentions include “cinema fascination desire”, “look image castration film object”, “hero side male act”, and “image audience voyeuristic spectator”. All of this tells me that cinema and its making centers women as desirable objects and not true heroes. 


## Interpretation and Conclusion 

By doing three methods of digital history, an Ngram viewer, a timeline, and textual analysis, I was able to see that the transition from academia to film has been dramatic and clear; women were observed to be sexualized in the primary text sources, and despite the heeding of these scholars, have been continually exploited on screen for the mass enjoyment of audiences and for profits of these corporations. For viewers, it is enjoyable and pleasurable. While rooted in cinema, these primary text works build off of each other and helped underline what the male gaze was. Despite not knowing whether or not these male filmmakers read all of these primary text samples, they definitely knew what they were doing when sexualizing and glorifying the female form. Without doing all three methods of analysis, I would not be able to provide you with a clear picture and justifiable evidence. Because of the three methods, I am able to answer the smaller questions: 

What is the male gaze? Who uses these terms?  The male gaze is a popular lens in which filmmakers sexualize women in their works. First coined by Laura Mulvey in autumn of 1975 in her essay titled, “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema”. Scholars, filmmakers, and the general public use the term when viewing and making films. This term helps us understand how bodies, traditionally and almost exclusively female, are shown and exploited on screen. In these films that I used as my examples, the male gaze is women who are damsels in distress that need saving (Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, Katie Holmes, etc.) and hot heroines who kick ass and look good doing it (Scarlett Johannson, Halle Berry, Jessica Alba, and Malin Akerman). 
 
What are the Marvel, DC, and Transformers franchises? These franchises are all based on comic books which have been developed for a big screen and in turn have blossomed into multi-billion dollar industries. The making of these films and the continuation of the male gaze helps these franchises thrive. While Marvel has made attempts recently to empower their heroines, they still sexualize them in tight suits and equip them with powers that are inferior to their male characters, or vilify them (present day examples include Black Widow and The Scarlet Witch). 

What does a transition entail? The transition entails from words on paper to practice. In Laura Mulvey’s original article, where the term “male gaze is coined”, the term is an observation. The transition I am focusing on is now a pattern in a male dominated industry in which the plot depends on women being helpless sexual beings. In all of my primary text examples, the idea is merely something that the authors are theorizing and has not been fully applied. By making these films in the context that they did, the directors of these films personified this theory and made it a reality. 

What does it mean to be in an academic world vs. popular culture? Academia equals further and detailed analysis, while popular culture entails criticism and the determination of whether the film was a “good” or “bad” movie. What constitutes a good or a bad movie is a whole other topic that could be explored in a digital history project. Popular culture is also mainstream and more likely to reach the general public.

How can we do better? Is there such a thing as the female gaze? We can do better by including female writers, directors, cinematographers, editors, and any female film collaborator on any project. By including a multitude of gender perspectives, we get even more well-rounded, inclusive, and overall better stories. In regards to a female gaze, the most obvious answer is that men are sexualized. However, all this does is stoop the female gaze down to the male gaze’s level and does nothing for the advancement of film. This digital history project doesn’t even begin to cover the depictions of BIPOC, LGBTQ+, and other demographics that need representation and equity in the industry.
